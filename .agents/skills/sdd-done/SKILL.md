# SDD Done

Use this skill when the user asks to run `sdd-done`, close a feature, push an
SDD worktree, open the feature PR, or clean up a completed SDD worktree.

Codex invocation: `$sdd-done FEAT-NNN [--dry-run] [--merge] [--force] [--resolve-jira] [--sync-down]`.

## Purpose

Verify evidence in the feature worktree, check for merge blockers scoped to
the current feature, snapshot ledger issues on base branch, stamp verification
on the feature branch, push it, open or describe the PR, and remove the worktree
when safe.

## Guardrails

- Run from the main repo, not inside `.claude/worktrees/`.
- Must be on the spec's `base_branch`.
- Do not modify the spec.
- Do not mark tasks done unless there is evidence in the worktree.
- Always show a verification report before writing closeout state.
- Hotfixes never merge directly to `main`.
- Hotfixes never push directly to `main`.
- For hotfixes, print a manual `gh pr create --base main` command instead of
  creating or merging the PR automatically.
- Use `--sync-down` only after the hotfix PR has merged to `main`.
- Use `--sync-dev` only as a deprecated alias for `--sync-down`.
- Merge gate checks apply only to `--merge` flag, not PR flow.
- Ledger snapshots use throwaway worktrees and never modify active worktrees.
- Hotfixes skip ledger snapshots.
- Bounded retry for rejected pushes (max 3 attempts).

## Workflow

1. Resolve feature:
   - scan `sdd/tasks/index/*.json`, excluding `_orphans.json`
   - match `feature_id`, numeric suffix, exact feature slug, or slug substring
   - read `feature`, `feature_id`, `spec`, `type`, and `base_branch`
2. Verify branch and location:
   - current path must not contain `.claude/worktrees/`
   - current branch must equal `base_branch`
3. Locate worktree:
   - prefer `git worktree list` match for `feat-<FEAT-ID>` or hotfix branch
   - if missing, check remote/local branches and report next steps
4. Gather evidence per task:
   - commits matching task ID or slug in the worktree
   - files listed in each task's "Files to Create / Modify" table exist in the
     worktree
   - do not rerun the whole test suite here; tests should have run during task
     execution
5. Classify:
   - `VERIFIED`: commit found and files exist
   - `PARTIAL`: commit found but files are missing
   - `NO EVIDENCE`: neither commits nor files support completion
6. Present verification report:
   - worktree
   - branch
   - commit count
   - task count by status
   - task-by-task evidence
7. Respect flags:
   - `--dry-run`: stop after the report
   - `--force`: allow forced closeout with partial/no evidence noted
   - otherwise ask before closing if any task is not verified
8. Stamp verification in the worktree branch:
   - update only `sdd/tasks/index/<feature>.json` inside the worktree
   - set each task `verification` to `verified`, `partial`, or `forced`
   - set feature `completed_at` only when all tasks are done
   - clear staging, stage only the index, verify cached names
   - commit `sdd: close tasks for FEAT-NNN - <feature-slug>`
9. Push feature branch:
   - `git -C <worktree> push origin <branch>`
10. Check merge blockers (feature flows only):
    - If `--merge` flag is set and not a hotfix, run `wikitoolkit ledger blockers <FEAT-ID>`
    - The command prints plain-text blocker lines (never JSON) and exits non-zero
      exactly when blockers exist — gate on the **exit code**, not on parsing its output
    - If blockers found and not `--force`, refuse merge and list the blockers
      (`wikitoolkit ledger acknowledge <ISSUE-ID> --reason "..." --actor human:<name>`
      is how a human resolves one)
    - If `--force`, warn but proceed with merge

11. Snapshot ledger issues (feature flows only):
    - For features (not hotfixes), `git fetch origin <BASE_BRANCH>` then create a
      throwaway detached worktree at `origin/<BASE_BRANCH>` (`git worktree add --detach`)
    - Run `wikitoolkit ledger export` there; only when its output contains `(changed)`:
      `git add sdd/ledger/issues.jsonl`, commit `sdd: ledger snapshot for <FEAT-ID>`,
      and `git push origin HEAD:<BASE_BRANCH>`
    - On a rejected push, `git fetch` + `git reset --hard origin/<BASE_BRANCH>` inside
      the throwaway worktree only, re-export, commit, push again — up to 3 attempts,
      then warn and continue without failing `/sdd-done`
    - Always `git worktree remove --force` the throwaway worktree afterward
    - Skip the snapshot entirely for hotfixes

12. Integrate:
    - If `base_branch == main`, refuse automatic merge or PR creation. Print
      the manual hotfix PR command:
      `gh pr create --base main --head <branch> --title "<title>" --body "<verification summary>"`.
    - If feature and no `--merge`, run `gh pr create --base <base_branch> --head <branch>`.
    - If `gh` is missing or not authenticated, print the manual command.
    - If feature and `--merge`, merge into `base_branch`, run
      `scripts/sdd/heal_orphans.sh <feature-slug>`, commit any staged orphan
      cleanup, and push `base_branch`.
11. Hotfix sync-down:
    - only with `--sync-down` or deprecated `--sync-dev`
    - verify feature branch is ancestor of `origin/main`
    - merge into `dev`, abort cleanly on conflict
    - leave user on `main`
12. Resolve Jira if requested:
    - find Jira key in spec or proposal metadata
    - prefer Jira MCP tools if available
    - fallback to configured Jira environment variables
    - transition to Done, Resolved, Ready for UAT, Complete, or Close
    - report missing credentials or missing transitions without failing closeout
13. Cleanup:
    - remove the worktree only after successful push/PR or merge path
    - if uncommitted changes exist in the worktree, ask before force removal
    - prune stale metadata if the worktree was already removed
    - delete local feature branch only when safe and merged/pushed

## Output

Report:

```text
FEAT-NNN - <title>: <closed>/<total> tasks closed
Branch pushed: <branch>
PR opened: <url> or manual command printed
Worktree removed: .claude/worktrees/<name>
Jira: <key> -> Done, when requested and successful
```
