"""SDD flow-type frontmatter parser shared across SDD commands and agents.

This module is the single source of truth for reading and emitting the
YAML frontmatter block that brainstorm/proposal/spec documents carry to
declare their SDD flow type and base branch.

The contract is intentionally tiny: a Pydantic model with a cross-field
validator, a forgiving ``parse`` that returns sensible defaults when no
frontmatter is present (so legacy specs keep working), and a symmetric
``emit`` used by generation commands when scaffolding new documents.

#: Canonical long-lived branches in the async-notify SDD Git Flow.
